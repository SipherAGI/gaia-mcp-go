## What is Gaia MCP Server?

The Gaia MCP Server is a bridge that connects MCP-compatible AI systems with Gaia's powerful AI image generation platform. Think of it as a translator that allows your AI assistant to understand your image requests and communicate with Gaia's servers to create the images you want.

**No technical knowledge required!** Simply follow our step-by-step setup guide, and you'll be generating images in minutes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **An MCP-compatible AI system** (see [Supported AI Systems](#supported-ai-systems) above)
- **A Gaia account** with available credits ([Sign up here](https://protogaia.com))
- **10 minutes** to complete the setup

### Step 1: Get Your Gaia API Key

Your API key is like a password that allows the server to access your Gaia account:

1. **Visit Gaia's Website**: Go to [protogaia.com](https://protogaia.com) and log in to your account
2. **Access Your Profile**: Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
3. **Go to Settings**: Select "Account Settings" or "Settings" from the dropdown menu
4. **Find Security Section**: Look for a "Security" or "API Keys" section
5. **Create New API Key**: Click "Create New API Key" or similar button
6. **Copy Your Key**: **Important!** Copy the generated API key immediately and save it somewhere safe - you won't be able to see it again

### Step 2: Download the Server

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/SipherAGI/gaia-mcp-go/releases) of this project
2. **Download for Your System**:
   - **Windows**: Download `gaia-mcp-go-windows.exe`
   - **Mac**: Download `gaia-mcp-go-darwin`
   - **Linux**: Download `gaia-mcp-go-linux`
3. **Save the File**: Save it to a location you'll remember (like your Desktop or Downloads folder)
4. **Note the Full Path**: You'll need to know exactly where you saved this file for the next step

### Step 3: Configure Your AI System

The configuration process varies depending on your AI system. We provide detailed instructions for Claude Desktop below, and general guidance for other systems.

#### Claude Desktop Setup

**Detailed step-by-step setup for Claude Desktop:**

1. **Open Claude Desktop** on your computer

2. **Access Settings**:

   - **Windows**: Go to File ‚Üí Settings
   - **Mac**: Go to Claude ‚Üí Settings (or use Cmd+,)

3. **Open Developer Settings**:

   - Click on the "Developer" tab
   - Click "Edit Config" button

4. **Add Configuration**: Replace everything in the configuration file with this code:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gaia-mcp-server": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/your/downloaded/gaia-mcp-go-file",
         "args": ["stdio", "--api-key=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Customize Your Configuration**:

   - Replace `/full/path/to/your/downloaded/gaia-mcp-go-file` with the actual location where you saved the downloaded file
   - Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you copied from Gaia

   **Example**:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gaia-mcp-server": {
         "command": "/Users/johndoe/Desktop/gaia-mcp-go-darwin",
         "args": ["stdio", "--api-key=gaia_1234567890abcdef"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Save and Close** the configuration window

#### Other MCP-Compatible Systems

**For other AI systems that support MCP:**

The general configuration pattern is:

```json
{
  "name": "gaia-mcp-server",
  "command": "/path/to/gaia-mcp-go-[your-system]",
  "args": ["stdio", "--api-key=YOUR_GAIA_API_KEY"]
}
```

**System-Specific Notes:**

- **Cline (VS Code)**: Add the server configuration to your Cline MCP settings
- **Zed Editor**: Configure in your Zed MCP settings file
- **Continue**: Add to your Continue extension MCP configuration
- **Custom Systems**: Use the stdio transport with the command and args shown above

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart your AI system** completely (close and reopen the application)

2. **Start a New Conversation**

3. **Test Image Generation**: Try asking your AI assistant something like:

   - "Generate an image of a peaceful mountain lake at sunset"
   - "Create a cartoon drawing of a friendly robot"
   - "Make an image of a cozy coffee shop interior"

4. **Success!** If everything is working, you should see your AI assistant generate and display your requested image directly in the conversation.
